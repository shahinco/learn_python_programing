An excerpt from Fear - By Thich Nhat Hanh
The Present Is Free from Fear
When we are not fully present, we are not really living. We're not
really there, either for our loved ones or for ourselves. If we're not
there, then where are we? We are running, running, running, even during
our sleep. We run because we're trying to escape from our fear.
